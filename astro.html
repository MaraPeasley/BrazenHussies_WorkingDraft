                <h3>HUSSYSCOPES for August</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Brazen astrological (sometimes astro-illogical) forecasts for your sun, moon and rising sign!</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>♈︎ ARIES.</strong> (March 21 - April 19) You want to go, go, GO! as usual. But you’ll be hit by some slow, slow, slooooowing down in the first part of the month. Don’t blame us, blame Mercury retrograde. Not feeling like your usual high energy self? Use some common sense and get checked out – and we are talking about your health.  Sigh..  yes, we KNOW you are always getting checked out in the other way because you flirt your *ss off.  In fact, by the middle of the month, your spontaneous flirty side will be out in full force when Mars hooks up with Jupiter. And with September on the horizon, you’ll likely feel a surge of, how shall we put it, romantic interest (simply put, you’ll be extra horny).
                    <br><br>
                    Your lyrical inspiration for the month: <br>
                    <strong>“You don't have to be cool to rule my world. Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with, I just want your extra time and your…kiss.” – Prince.</strong>
                    <br><br>

                    
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>♉︎ TAURUS.</strong> ((April 20 - May 20).  Venus, the love planet, rules your sign and lovey dovey-ness is usually your forte. But there’s tension from Uranus for a little while. It could be making you a tad  nostalgic and blue. Over what? We can’t tell you everything, darlings. But we can tell you to avoid taking out your bad mood on others. Bottom line: Calm the f*ck down! Be kind. Be patient. The “retro” part of Mercury retrograde will soon make you smile. Don’t be surprised when it brings old buds back into your life. More good news: Uranus gets cozy instead of cranky with Venus by the 27th and sparks (the sexy kind) can fly with the one you love.
                    <br><br>
                    Your lyrical inspiration for the month: <br>
                    <strong>"I feel nice, like sugar and spice. So nice, so nice, I got YOU.” – James Brown.</strong>
                    <br><br>


                    <br><br>
                    <strong>♊︎ GEMINI</strong> (May 21 - June 20). It’s time to put on your big hussy or huss-he pants (from jeans to silver lame) and think “persistence.” Your plans had glitches lately, but stop being a drama queen. Look on the bright side: Mercury retrograde isn’t bringing many annoying changes and non-fun surprises to your sign. What’s even better? The full moon on August 19.  Finally, darlings! Your brazen wishes and dreams could manifest and that influence goes all the way to September. It’s not magic but the pay-off of putting your creative and hard-working, adorable *ss in gear. So, what if plans and dreams have changed!? Adjust  your course and head for better days toward what your heart needs.
                    <br><br>
                    Your lyrical inspiration for the month: <br>
                    <strong>“You can’t always get what you want, but sometimes you get what you need.” – Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.</strong>
                    <br><br>


                    <br><br>
                    <strong>♋︎ CANCER.</strong> (June 21 - July 22).  Yep, you’ve been wondering whether to go this way or that when it comes to making money. Stop agonizing – it causes crow’s feet, darlings! Besides, the intuitive new moon on August 4 lights the way for you to consider something new and brazen for your career. What do you REALLY want to do? Mercury retrograde is in your communication sector, so try not to worry if emails and phone calls aren’t answered ASAP.  Be patient. An important conversation over the next few weeks could be life changing. As August draws closer to September, the sun cozies up to Mercury – watch for a glow-up of financial opportunities (along with love). 
                    <br><br>
                    Your lyrical inspiration for the month: <br>
                    <strong>“It’s been a long, long time coming, but I know a change is change is gonna come, oh, yes it is…” Sam Cooke.</strong>
                    <br><br>


                    <br><br>
                    <strong>♌︎ LEO</strong> (July 23 – August 22). The sun is shining on you like a spotlight. No, we are NOT suggesting the cops are after you, darlings. We are talking about attention of the good sort – your brilliant star quality! The new moon on the 4th aims right at your heartfelt desire to dip. or even better, step boldly into a new image and that energy keeps on keeping on!!! You aren’t disguising but revealing the REAL brazen you – your fresh ideas, talents, and chutzpah. Mercury retrograde will simply delay a few plans temporarily.  As the month ends, spend more time with the special ones you dazzle and love.
                    <br><br>
                    Your lyrical inspiration for the month: <br>
                    <strong>“Here comes the sun, and I say it's alright.” – John Lennon and Paul McCartney.</strong>
                    <br><br>


                    <br><br>
                    <strong>♍︎ VIRGO</strong> (August 23 – September 22). The sun is in your 12th house (we aren’t talking about your real estate investment, but your horoscope, dears). Use the positive side of Mercury retrograde - slow down, take deep breaths and work behind-the-scenes pursuing dreams, creative projects, magical goings-on, and healing from stress and anxiety. Whaaat? You don’t HAVE any stress or anxiety? Darlings, let’s not fib. Have a massage, a new ‘do, a plastic surgery consult! Let go of someone who is more hurtful than helpful and loving. As the sun gets close to Virgo, fiery Mars links to Jupiter’s energy. Woohoo! An unexpected, fab opportunity and lots of smiles await on the road ahead!
                    <br><br>
                    Your lyrical inspiration for the month: <br>
                    <strong>“I ain't saying you treated me unkind, you could've done better but I don't mind.  You just kind of wasted my precious time.. But don't think twice, it's alright.” – Bob Dylan.</strong>
                    <br><br>


                    <br><br>
                    <strong>♎︎ LIBRA</strong> (September 23 – October 22). Are you involved in group things? Venus, the planet of love, is squaring trouble-maker Uranus in part of your sky dealing with group activities - things like participating in volunteer work, or a book or garden club, or being a member of Congress (well, there probably IS a brazen hussy or huss-he in there).. stuff like that. Now that we think about it (not that we normally think about it, darlings), orgies are a group activity! But this portends nothing like that - just a few annoying glitches in your group endeavors. Mercury retrograde won’t be a huge bother this go ‘round but can bring some misunderstandings. So be flexible, darlings -- and keep your sense of humor!
                    <br><br>
                    Your lyrical inspiration for the month: <br>
                    <strong>“Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy, it's not your style.   You'll look so good that you'll be glad you decide to smile!” - Lee Adams and Charles Strous.</strong>
                    <br><br>


                    <br><br>
                    <strong>♏︎ SCORPIO</strong> (October 23 – November 21).  The career part of your sky is loaded this month with confidence vibes radiating on you, sweeties. That’s especially good news because you’ve likely had more than one big bump on the career path lately. The sun is powering up your multiple talents which include being somewhat sneaky (well, so was James Bond!) as well as super smart. Important people are noticing you in a good way, darlings. Mercury retrograde could screw up biz communications so take extra care. Don’t be surprised if people from the past want to suddenly talk about your talents and availability. Love or family snits could be healed now if you stop having to be right about everything!
                    <br><br>
                    Your lyrical inspiration for the month: <br>
                    <strong>“Forget your troubles, c'mon get happy. You better chase all your cares away.” -- Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler.</strong>
                    <br><br>


                    <br><br>
                    <strong>♐︎ SAGITTARIUS</strong> (November 22 – December 21).  Your wanderlust (emphasis on “lust”) is calling you to take a trip or at least trek outside your normal boundaries. The sun is shining on the part on your Hussyscope that calls to adventure. But hold on! Mercury is retrograde there most of the month. Consider keeping your explorations closer to home for now – plan some new adventures in a month or two.  Besides, sweetie darlings, later in the month, Mars and plucky, lucky Jupiter (your ruling planet) align and the outlook is what? Wowser! Some potentially wild days in a few weeks or months (we mean “wild” in the best way) await.
                    <br><br>
                    Your lyrical inspiration for the month: <br>
                    <strong>“Whether I'm right or whether I'm wrong, whether I find a place in this world or never belong, I gotta be me, I gotta be me.”  -- Walter Marks.</strong>
                    <br><br>


                    <br><br>
                    <strong>♑︎ CAPRICORN</strong> (December 22 – January 19).  Aha! We do believe you have bit of the spy in you this month (and, of course, you look extra brazenly fab in those wrap around shades and the trench coat).You’re focused on getting to the bottom – whether good, bad, or just pissy – of something you suspect has been hidden from you. Venus in the 9th house encourages zeroing in on  suspicions. But calm down! Maybe someone simply forgot to spill those beans – or you missed a message – because of Mercury retrograde! Besides, the new moon energy earlier in the month brings a revitalizing connection for six months. Don’t pussyfoot around about pursuing it…
                    <br><br>
                    Your lyrical inspiration for the month: <br>
                    <strong>“What's new, pussycat? Whoa-oh, whoa-oh.. You’re delicious and all your wishes can soon come true…“ – Burt Bacharach.</strong>
                    <br><br>


                    <br><br>
                    <strong>♒︎ AQUARIUS</strong> (January 20 – February 19).  You’ve been hyper focused on one of the great loves of your life -- the money, honey. And you’ve had reasons to be cash conscious. The planetary line-up in August brings advice heralded by the new moon in Leo earlier, nudging you to focus more on relationships, darlings. You may be saying goodbye to a couple of old friends for now during the Mercury retrograde because you’ve simply grown apart. But, odds are, most will circle back in your direction next year. The vibes of the full moon in your sign on the 19th inspire with a burst of creativity.  You’ll look extra fabulous, because you’re smiling more!
                    <br><br>
                    Your lyrical inspiration for the month: <br>
                    <strong>“Don’t lose your confidence if you slip. Be grateful for a pleasant trip and pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start all over again.” – Nat King Cole.</strong>
                    <br><br>


                    <br><br>
                    <strong>♓︎ PISCES</strong> (February 20 – March19). Darlings, consider rejuvenation – not just cosmetic procedures (of course, we would NEVER consider them for ourselves… cough), but the glow and glam from feeling and looking your brazen best. The sun in Leo is activating your wellness zone! Haven’t worked out in a while? Start with yoga. Looking for love? Don’t bother. Love is looking for YOU. Be open and let it succeed. Mercury retrograde likely keeps you closer to home for a few weeks. It’s an opportunity to find new ways (wink, wink) to connect if you’re in a relationship. The Aquarius full moon on August 19 nudges your imaginative, creative side for many weeks ahead - making you even sexier than usual.
