                If a romantic evening watching classic movies full of passion, romance, bravery and swashbuckling starring TRUE stars from Hollywood’s Golden Age - Olivia de Havilland and Errol Flynn --sounds like your cup o’tea or glass of bubbly, read on.
                <br><br>
                The extraordinarily talented and beautiful Olivia de Havilland and Errol Flynn starred in eight movies together – you can likely find all of them on Turner Classic Movies or Amazon Prime.  They include Robin Hood, Captain Blood and Charge of the Light Brigade. 
                <br><br>
                And if you feel a palpable passion between the two stars when you watch their performances, it’s not just cinematic magic, darlings.
                <br><br>
                Should you have any hormonal action left in your body, you’ll likely be swept up into the passion depicted on the screen by these two gorgeous stars. And, it turns out, they shared a deep, if not consummated (according to both Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland) love.
                <br><br>
                In the years when Errol and Olivia were no longer in each other’s arms on the screen (or, possibly, off it) Miss de Havilland married a French man, Paris Match  editor and journalist Pierre Galante, and moved to France. The marriage didn’t last for many years, but Olivia’s love for France did. She lived in Paris for the rest of her life.
                <br><br>
                Errol Flynn’s life went in another direction. He had many relationships, too many fueled by his alcohol addiction. He died at 50 from a heart attack. His alcoholism, which had aged him, sent his career downhill, and likely contributed to his death.
                <br><br>
                Olivia de Havilland had never stopped caring for Errol Flynn.
                <br><br> 
                She recounted her memories of him in interviews and her biography, including how they first met:  "I had an unhappy experience in Hollywood. A tall man kissed me on the back of the neck at a party and I whirled around in anger and said, 'Do I know you?' Then I realized it was Errol Flynn.”
                <br><br>
                And what she revealed after his passing was a true story, a life lesson for us all – it’s about going ahead and telling someone what's in your heart, even if it seems a small thing, or if you assume that he or she might think you are silly. 
                <br><br>
                In Errol Flynn’s last years, when Olivia saw him occasionally, there was something profoundly different about him
                <br><br>
                “He had changed so. His eyes were so sad. I had stared into them in enough movies to know his spirit was gone,
                <br><br> 
                “Years later I saw a rerun of 'Robin Hood'. I wrote him a long letter telling him it had brought back fond memories. Seeing 'Robin Hood' after all those years made me realize how good all our adventure films were, and I wrote Errol that I was glad I had been in every scene of them. 
                <br><br>
                But I tore up the letter. I reconsidered, deciding Errol would think I was silly. 
                <br><br>
                I'll always be sorry I didn't mail that letter. A few months later, he was dead." -- Olivia de Havilland.
                <br><br>
                Miss de Havilland lived to be 104, by the way. She passed away in her sleep in her Paris apartment on July 26, 2020.
                <br><br>
                I have a feeling, darlings, that Olivia de Havilland and Errol Flynn would love to know we can go back in time and fuel our own romantic souls with the magic they created on the screen.
