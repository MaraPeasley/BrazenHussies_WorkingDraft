            <p>“Life is far too important to take seriously.” -- Oscar Wilde.
                <br><br>
                What is this BrazenHussies.com thing ABOUT?  We’re so glad you asked!
                It’s about giving yourself permission to wear that glittery something you might have bought at a thrift store or Saks – it doesn’t matter. What matters is it makes you feel like a movie star and makes your smile or laugh.
                <br><br>
                It’s about declaring it’s ok to be a bit eccentric, even a bit outré…  to dress, think and express yourself in a way that is bold and true to who you are.  
                <br><br>
                It’s also about recognizing that there’s a whole lot, still, to laugh about in this world.  
                <br><br>
                And it’s about refusing to say that at a particular age, you become automatically “less than” you were when you could fit into tiny teen size jeans. You will never be any younger, so revel in the experience, attitude and sheer YOU-ness of you right now – whether you are 25, 55 or 85!  After all, as Dorothy Parker said, “Age doesn’t matter unless you are cheese.”
                <br><br>
                The Brazen Hussies website is not about being mean spirited but it is about freeing yourself to point out when the Emperor, or Empress, isn’t wearing any clothes. In a word – okokokoKAY, fourteen words – it’s about not hesitating for a nanosecond to be proudly and brazenly politically incorrect when needed.
                <br><br>
                Brazen Hussies (and Huss-HES) declare that living with verve and pizazz, delicious daring and, most importantly, with recognition of just how nutty life can be is transformational. Becoming a legend in your own mind doesn’t equate to deluding yourself– instead, it’s creating your own internal power source and giving yourself permission to have your own adventures, opinions and personal style instead of living through others.
                <br><br>
                The Brazen Hussies’ philosophy can be summed up by this famous line from Auntie Mame, “Life’s a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death!”
                <br><br>
                So, stop starving and whet your brazen appetite with what you find hanging out with us over here – a smorgasbord of wit and wiles served up by what is quickly becoming known on all over the world, and possibly Mars and beyond, as “Hussiedom”. 
                <br><br>
                OKokokok… we made up the last part but stranger things have happened and we have some of our real-life stories to prove it! Stay tuned….and <br>WELCOME to HUSSIEDOM!  
                <br><br>
                – Sher.

                        <h4>Sher</h4>
                        <h5>Brazen Hussies Founder</h5>
                        <p>Yes, darlings, I am the founder and Supreme Hussy of the Brazen Hussies. 
                        And if that makes me sound a little, shall we say, different – why, YES!
                        <br><br>
                        I’m a writer (in my alternative life as a journalist I’ve written for a gazillion of national publications – including the long gone but dearly remembered OMNI magazine which propelled me into the new frontiers and explains some of my eclectic and clearly brazen interests).
                        <br><br> 
                        I’m also a playwright. (You’ll learn more about that in the future, so stay tuned.)
                        <br><br>
                        I’m an artist, too. And, yes, many moons ago I did everything from restore paintings to model bikinis and I worked in the film industry here and there. And I’ve done work for a mayor, hung out with with a president and, often had out-of-the blue encounters and conversations with celebrities, which I’ll be sharing as we revamp (emphasis on “vamp”) the Brazen Hussies. 
                        Sooooooo, what did all of this bizarro mix of experience and talent and, well, chutzpah result in? Moi.
                        <br><br>
                        Yes, I’m a somewhat nutty, outspoken, still madly in love with the same impossible man (Cary Grant, yes, I KNOW he’s dead) and still swooning over pictures of Marlene Dietrich. I never said I was “normal”…
                        <br><br>
                        There’s a B word that better fits me and it’s not “boring” - some might say that B word is the one that rhymes with “itch.”  But keep exploring the Hussies, darling, and you’ll see why I’m proudly BRAZEN --- and hope the curiosity and brazenly broad interests of the Brazen Hussies entertains and even sometimes enlightens hussies and huss-hes all over the planet.

                        <p>Many moons ago (I haven’t mooned anyone in a long time, I promise) I was a Dolly Parton impersonator (yes, I stuffed my bra) and a Mae West impersonator (no, I did not stuff my bra). 
                        <br><br>
                        I am returning to my singing and acting roots (and getting my roots touched up as well) while trying new stuff, like writing for this brazenly fab and funny (some might say crazy) website. I’m  stoking my entertainment roots ( and also having my blonde roots touched up from time to time.. but I digress).
                        <br><br>
                        Steve Martin may have been born a poor black child, but I was born a Southern Baptist preacher’s daughter. Steve was kidding. I am not. This is proof that God has a sense of humor since that fact is obviously a joke of cosmic proportions, and the joke was on me. 
                        <br><br>
                        People used to pay me to entertain them. That is something I want to make happen again, so please read my stuff and make my dream come true or I will put a spell on you.

                        "The Laughing Heart"
                        by Charles Bukowski
                        <br><br>
                        your life is your life<br>
                        don’t let it be clubbed into dank submission.<br>
                        be on the watch.<br>
                        there are ways out.<br>
                        there is light somewhere.<br>
                        it may not be much light but<br>
                        it beats the darkness.<br>
                        be on the watch.<br>
                        the gods will offer you chances.<br>
                        know them.<br>
                        take them.<br>
                        you can’t beat death but<br>
                        you can beat death in life, sometimes.<br>
                        and the more often you learn to do it,<br>
                        the more light there will be.<br>
                        your life is your life.<br>
                        know it while you have it.<br>
